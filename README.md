# ProcSuspend
Suspend processes immediately and dump auto-closing apps.

# Why do I need this?
Sometimes there are programs which are closed by themselves when ther are done in too little time. With ProcSuspend, you can suspend it immediately after starting them and dump/analyze them easily.

# How does it works?
ProcSuspend runs and suspends the program. And when you press any key, it resumes the process for the delay you set. Then it suspends again.

# Build
Visual studio 2017 is enough.
.NET Framework 4.7.2
